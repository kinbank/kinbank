mFBeS,!kun!a,,male speaker's father's brother's older son,,,lee_dobe_2013,"!Kung/ju'hoansi kinship patterns alternate generational names. Thus, Egos generation, and their grandparents/grandchildren all share the same terms. They are all !kun!a/tun or !kuma/tuma depending on if the person is older/younger than the speaker. Ego's parents and children therefore also have the same kinship terminology. "
