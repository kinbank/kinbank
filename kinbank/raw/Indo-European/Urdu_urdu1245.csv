meZ,āpā,,,,"IE188(347,348)",ahmad_muslim_1977,"the Hindu terms of address for the older sister, dīdī and jījī are never used by the Muslims; the Hindus never use the corresponding Muslim terms of address, āpā and bājī, both of Turkish origin and probably in use since the Delhi Sultanate period.        The terms äpä (used by the Qarluq Turkmans) and äbä (by the Oghuz Turks) were originally used for the mother, whereas the standard terms of reference for the elder sister in Old Turkish were äčä and äkä. [...] But in Chaghtay Turkish the terms  apa and  buyuk apa came to be used for the older sister also [...]. Borrowed in Persian from Turkish the term  āpā was used both for mother and sister [...]. Bājī for elder sister was used by the Krim Tatars, and in Ottoman Turkish while in Azarī it was  āghā bājī or  abājī; the Chagtay Turkish form was  bāčī (bāchī) [...]. However the form bājī was borrowed into Persian [...], and through it into Urdu [...] The term  bājī was perhaps more in use in the later Mughal period than  āpā (as in his dictionary of terms compiled in the eighteenth century Mukhlis records the former term, but not the latter[...]). In Urdu the urban 'ashrāf' of North India tend to use the term  āpā which is also used int he Deccan while the term  bājī is used in the rural areas both by the 'ashrāf' and the 'ajlāf' (occupational castes).

fFyB,chachā,,,,IE292,noauthor_lahnda_nodate,"chachā ""father's younger brother"" FyB; The terms for father's younger brother chachā and kākā, the former of which is generally used in Urdu is derived from kākā which is still used in Hindi but not in Urdu and is, curiously enough closer to its Turkish origin.    The term  kāka had an interesting history. The term qā was borrowed from Chinese through Uigur in Old Turkish in the compound term  ka kadesh [...] meaning family and kinsmen. In Ottoman Turkish  kaka (qaqa) was used for older brother or foster-brother [...] but not for father's brother. It came to be used in the latter sense in Indo-Persian, probably in the Mughal period, but was also used for the older brother or an old slave as a fictive term [...]. The explanation may be found in the status of father's brother in Indo-Muslim society who had something of the father's authority though the mother's brother was held in greater affection.      This attitude, which must have been very strong in the upper-class Muslim society of the Mughal period, in which the father's brother took care of the orphaned nephews, as the Manṣabdāri system was not hereditary, seems to have influenced the Muslim society, in which as in the Hindu society such care was binding in the extended family system [...] [188];                            extra info:                   The father's brother's authority is also reflected in the Urdu terms barā abbā (big father) and chotta abbā (little father) used respectively for the father's older and younger brothers. Even among the Nawāyat, one of the communities of South Indian West Coast claiming Arab patrilineal descent and retaining traces of certain matrilineal practices which are undoubtedly of local South Indian rather than pre-Islamic Arabian origin, the rich terminology for father's brother reflects his great importance in the kinship network. The Nawāyat use five different successive terms for father's first five brothers: woḍeppā for the eldest and then successively goreppā, awppā, hakappa and kocheppa. The Konkani suffix -ppa is the dimunitive form of bāppā( father), while the general term for the father's brothers (bāpūlyo) is also from the same root (reference to Victor D'Souza [1953]) [188]; chacha ""father's younger brother"" [363]; chacha ""father's younger brother"" [292]"
