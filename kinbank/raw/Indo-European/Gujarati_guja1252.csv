mF,pitā,,,,IE9(106),basu_sociolinguistic_1974,"pitā, from pitṛ (Sanskrit), ""father"", used in the New Indo Aryan languages in high-style writing [9]; the term  pitājī has been heard by the author (Pocock) as a term of reference, but not in address (only written in older novels); also:  kākā: this term is not uncommon as a form of address and appears to have been more common in the past (kākā now most commonly used for the FB) [108]; Beside [these] [the modern] words, the words tãya or tãu are also found in old Gujarãti. [...] The words tãu and tãya are not found in modern literature.    Besides these words, purely Sanskrit words like tãta, pitã etc. are used, the word  patyãjī, probably from pitã, is used in folktales [96]"

mM,mā,,,,IE108(165),basu_sociolinguistic_1974,"mā ""mother"", also: bā; this is used for reference and address; another term of reference is  jaṇati or janani, but the author (Pocock) never heard it used; also Karve is cited who gives the terms  māḍi and  māvaḍi as diminutives of  mā but Pocock also never heard these; bā  suffixed to a woman's name often takes the place of  ben in honourable old age [108]; the Tadbhava of the term  mātā is commonly found as  mā (in Gujarati and several other languages) [9];  The word most commonly used [for mother] is mā, with its variant māḍi or māvaḍi. The words found in old Gujarãti are māya or mãyaḍī, māyi or mãyī. 
The other word used in modern times is bā. It is however not found in older literature or in folksongs. The purely Sanskrit words mātā is used in folksongs. [96]; mā, bā ""mother's brother"" [223]"

These terms are used in reference and address. For Dumont’s  larka I have  laḍakā and variants used in address only and usually to a small male child. The word is used almost exactly as ‘sweetheart’ in English. [108]; In modern Gujarātī the word used is dīkaro. It is sometimes used to mean a boy without the kinship connotation. This word is not found in old Gujarātī.        The word betā is found in both modern and old Gujarātī.
In old Gujarāti the word putta, puttu, puta and suya are used. They are not
found in modem Gujarāti. 
Besides these words the word gagā is used in Kāthiāwād. 
The word mobhī meaning the main beam on which the roof is supported, is used in the sense of ‘son’, because the son represents the support of the house. Besides these, purely Sanskrit words like putra, tanaya etc. are used in literature in modern times. The words pūta and chaiyo are found in folk-sayings even in modern times. [96]; dikro,  gagā ""son"" [223]"
mD,dīkrī,,,,IE9(106),basu_sociolinguistic_1974,"dīkrī ""daughter"" (adding ī to the word for son to make it feminine, see S); the word  dīkrī might be an extension from  dhia (Middle Indo Aryan, derived from Sanskrit duhitā / dhītā) with contamination of  chokrī ""girl"" [9]; beṭī ""daughter""; also  dīkrī [155]; dikari ""daughter""; this is  the most common among the Patidar, but  beṭi is also heard.

mFF,dāda,,,,IE9(108),basu_sociolinguistic_1974,"dāda ""grandfather"" [9]; dādā ""paternal grandfather""; in address the respect suffix -jī is added [108]; there are no independent terms for grandfather.

In old Gujarāti the word kalatta, gharani or gehini, bhajja or bhajjā, are used.        The word vahu is used also for the bride and the word vahuvāru is used for the women of a family who belong to it by marriage and not by birth. In this sense the word is the antithesis of the word mahyāri which connotes the women born in a family.

There thus appears to be a tendency toward the simplification of the kinship terminology. While some of the old terms are lost, the addition of new terms is also very small.

This would only be true of higher castes and of the Patidar of the towns and wealthier villages. For such the term means simply ‘woman’ and could not suitably be used of a man’s wife. In smaller villages among the bulk of the Patidar and in the truly rural sections of other castes, including Brahmans, bāiri has no pejorative associations and quite simply means ‘wife’. There is no reason why this should not be so. The word is only a variant of bāiḍi, a diminutive for mother.

In old Gujarāti the word kalatta, gharani or gehini, bhajja or bhajjā, are used.        The word vahu is used also for the bride and the word vahuvāru is used for the women of a family who belong to it by marriage and not by birth. In this sense the word is the antithesis of the word mahyāri which connotes the women born in a family.

This would only be true of higher castes and of the Patidar of the towns and wealthier villages. For such the term means simply ‘woman’ and could not suitably be used of a man’s wife. In smaller villages among the bulk of the Patidar and in the truly rural sections of other castes, including Brahmans, bāiri has no pejorative associations and quite simply means ‘wife’. There is no reason why this should not be so. The word is only a variant of bāiḍi, a diminutive for mother.

In old Gujarāti the word kalatta, gharani or gehini, bhajja or bhajjā, are used.        The word vahu is used also for the bride and the word vahuvāru is used for the women of a family who belong to it by marriage and not by birth. In this sense the word is the antithesis of the word mahyāri which connotes the women born in a family.

There thus appears to be a tendency toward the simplification of the kinship terminology. While some of the old terms are lost, the addition of new terms is also very small. [...] [96:217]; vahu, bairi ""wife"" [223]    bāiri ""wife"", very commonly used; citation: Mrs. Karve observes that this last term (bāiri) ‘is not supposed to be very respectable’. This would only be true of higher castes and of the Patidar of the towns and wealthier villages. For such the term means simply ‘woman’ and could not suitably be used of a man’s wife. In smaller villages among the bulk of the Patidar and in the truly rural sections of other castes, including Brahmans, bāiri has no pejorative associations and quite simply means ‘wife’. There is no reason why this should not be so. The word is only a variant of bāiḍi, a diminutive for mother. A husband addresses and refers to his wife as so-and-so’s mother and inquiries about the wife and messages are conveyed by some such circumlocution as ‘How are all at your house?’ and ‘You are called from your house to eat’, etc. [108]"

[...] [96:217]; vahu, bairi ""wife"" [223]    bāiri ""wife"", very commonly used; citation: Mrs. Karve observes that this last term (bāiri) ‘is not supposed to be very respectable’. This would only be true of higher castes and of the Patidar of the towns and wealthier villages. For such the term means simply ‘woman’ and could not suitably be used of a man’s wife. In smaller villages among the bulk of the Patidar and in the truly rural sections of other castes, including Brahmans, bāiri has no pejorative associations and quite simply means ‘wife’. There is no reason why this should not be so. The word is only a variant of bāiḍi, a diminutive for mother. A husband addresses and refers to his wife as so-and-so’s mother and inquiries about the wife and messages are conveyed by some such circumlocution as ‘How are all at your house?’ and ‘You are called from your house to eat’, etc. [108]"

Most often the husband is referred to by the third-person pronoun with some slight emphasis to mark the usage. In speaking to the wife there is no clear rule about avoiding the husband’s name, although people tend to do so; [...] What Dumont observes for Gorakhpur is true here also: ‘This is a delicate subject, the wife does not address her husband directly or speak his name, and reciprocally, the husband most often has recourse to tecnonymy. . .

In old Gujarāti the word kalatta, gharani or gehini, bhajja or bhajjā, are used.        The word vahu is used also for the bride and the word vahuvāru is used for the women of a family who belong to it by marriage and not by birth. In this sense the word is the antithesis of the word mahyāri which connotes the women born in a family.    (These may go to other families after their marriage but as mahyāris they have certain rights and duties to perform on certain occasions). [96]; vahu, bairi ""wife"" [223]"

[96:213]; In old Gujarati there are many, words for wife like bhajjā or bhajja, kalatta, gharaṇī and vahu; of these only vahu is retained in modern times, and to it is added the word bāiṛi (equivalent to Marathi bayako), which however is not supposed to be very respectable. There thus appears to be a tendency toward the simplification of the kinship terminology. While some of the old terms are lost, the addition of new terms is also very small. [...] [96:217]; vahu, bairi ""wife"" [223]    bāiri ""wife"", very commonly used; citation: Mrs. Karve observes that this last term (bāiri) ‘is not supposed to be very respectable’. This would only be true of higher castes and of the Patidar of the towns and wealthier villages. For such the term means simply ‘woman’ and could not suitably be used of a man’s wife. In smaller villages among the bulk of the Patidar and in the truly rural sections of other castes, including Brahmans, bāiri has no pejorative associations and quite simply means ‘wife’. There is no reason why this should not be so. The word is only a variant of bāiḍi, a diminutive for mother. A husband addresses and refers to his wife as so-and-so’s mother and inquiries about the wife and messages are conveyed by some such circumlocution as ‘How are all at your house?’ and ‘You are called from your house to eat’, etc. [108]"

In the middle and low levels of the caste the term sāḷā can be used as a slightly vulgar term of intimacy. If used in anger it is a term of abuse. The terms are used in exclamation quite often when no one is being addressed or referred to specifically, as follows: ‘Oh the sāḷā rain has started’ or ‘My sāḷā [..] back aches’.

Where widow-remarriage is permitted the commonest form would be between the widow and her diyar. This is called diyavaṭuṅ.

found in modem Gujarāti. 
Besides these words the word gagā is used in Kāthiāwād. 
The word mobhī meaning the main beam on which the roof is supported, is used in the sense of ‘son’, because the son represents the support of the house.

fW,bāiri,,,,DR7(149),tisdall_simplified_1892,"bāyḍi ""woman, wife"" [155:161];   bhārajā (one of the terms for wife) (resembles bāiri?) [96:213]; In old Gujarati there are many, words for wife like bhajjā or bhajja, kalatta, gharaṇī and vahu; of these only vahu is retained in modern times, and to it is added the word bāiṛi (equivalent to Marathi bayako), which however is not supposed to be very respectable. There thus appears to be a tendency toward the simplification of the kinship terminology. While some of the old terms are lost, the addition of new terms is also very small. [...] [96:217]; vahu, bairi ""wife"" [223]    bāiri ""wife"", very commonly used; citation: Mrs. Karve observes that this last term (bāiri) ‘is not supposed to be very respectable’. This would only be true of higher castes and of the Patidar of the towns and wealthier villages. For such the term means simply ‘woman’ and could not suitably be used of a man’s wife. In smaller villages among the bulk of the Patidar and in the truly rural sections of other castes, including Brahmans, bāiri has no pejorative associations and quite simply means ‘wife’. There is no reason why this should not be so. The word is only a variant of bāiḍi, a diminutive for mother. A husband addresses and refers to his wife as so-and-so’s mother and inquiries about the wife and messages are conveyed by some such circumlocution as ‘How are all at your house?’ and ‘You are called from your house to eat’, etc. [108]"
