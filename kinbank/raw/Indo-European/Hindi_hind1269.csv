In Pali Jātska  mahāpitā was used for ""grandfather"" and cullapitā for ""father""); the  ka suffix might have been used to denote ""slightly less than"". As both FF and FeB could be considered slightly less than the father in estimation, tātaka might have been used for them.

If it was ""the owner"" it did not possibly suggest ""the owner of the wife"", because the ""wife"" was patnī ""the female owner"" or ""the mistress"" and jointly ""the husband and the wife"" were  dampatī, that is, the master and the mistress of the house or household objects. The use of the word  pati in the sense of both ""the husband"" and ""the master"" is found in Sanskrit.

If it was ""the owner"" it did not possibly suggest ""the owner of the wife"", because the ""wife"" was patnī ""the female owner"" or ""the mistress"" and jointly ""the husband and the wife"" were  dampatī, that is, the master and the mistress of the house or household objects.

Even in some Dravidian languages this term is used as a loanword. Regarding its original sense, there is controversy. Benveniste [...] suggests that the meaning of the word might be derived from ""self"", connecting it with Av. paiti, and Mayrhofer [...] derives it from the verb-root meaning ""to own"", and gives the etymological meaning ""the owner"". If it was ""the owner"" it did not possibly suggest ""the owner of the wife"", because the ""wife"" was patnī ""the female owner"" or ""the mistress"" and jointly ""the husband and the wife"" were  dampatī, that is, the master and the mistress of the house or household objects. The use of the word  pati in the sense of both ""the husband"" and ""the master"" is found in Sanskrit.

The explanation may be found in the status of father's brother in Indo-Muslim society who had something of the father's authority though the mother's
brother was held in greater affection. This attitude, which must have been very strong in the upper-class Muslim society of the Mughal period, in which the father's brother took care of the orphaned nephews, as the Manṣabdāri system was not hereditary, seems to have influenced the Muslim society, in which as in the Hindu society such care was binding in the extended family system [...] [188]; caca ""father's brother"" [219]; chāchā ""'father's younger brother"", also: kākā [223]"

The term qā was borrowed from Chinese through Uigur in Old Turkish in the compound term  ka kadesh [...] meaning family and kinsmen. In Ottoman Turkish  kaka (qaqa) was used for older brother or foster-brother [...] but not for father's brother. It came to be used in the latter sense in Indo-Persian, probably in the Mughal period, but was also used for the older brother or an old slave as a fictive term [...]. The explanation may be found in the status of father's brother in Indo-Muslim society who had something of the father's authority though the mother's
brother was held in greater affection. This attitude, which must have been very strong in the upper-class Muslim society of the Mughal period, in which the father's brother took care of the orphaned nephews, as the Manṣabdāri system was not hereditary, seems to have influenced the Muslim society, in which as in the Hindu society such care was binding in the extended family system [...] [188]; caca ""father's brother"" [219]; chāchā ""'father's younger brother"", also: kākā [223], doubt mentioned above is correct - caca would refer to younger brother - correction as Speaker IE22"

brother was held in greater affection. This attitude, which must have been very strong in the upper-class Muslim society of the Mughal period, in which the father's brother took care of the orphaned nephews, as the Manṣabdāri system was not hereditary, seems to have influenced the Muslim society, in which as in the Hindu society such care was binding in the extended family system [...] [188]; caca ""father's brother"" [219]; chāchā ""'father's younger brother"", also: kākā [223], doubt mentioned above is correct - caca would refer to younger brother - correction as Speaker IE22"
